# QuantaIQ / IDIS – Phase 1 Status Report & Architecture Review

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** May 29, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Phase 1 Complete · 🔄 Phase 1.5 In Progress

---

## 1. Project Vision & Core Goal

**Vision:**  
To create an AI-powered middleware system ("QuantaIQ" or "IDIS") that transforms fragmented documents into actionable insights. Initially focused on medical records, with future expansion into legal and other professional domains. Designed to be modular, intelligent, and increasingly autonomous—eventually forming a distributed, interoperable system. "Turning noise into knowledge."

**Phase 1 Goal:**  
Build a fully functional backend pipeline on a local appliance-style setup, capable of:
- Document ingestion
- AI-assisted extraction & classification
- Summarization
- Metadata tagging
- Filing
- Smart cover sheet generation

---

## 2. Architecture Overview (Phase 1 MVP)

### 🧠 Modular Agent-Based Design
- **ContextStore** – Persistent metadata and audit trail (SQLite)
- **IngestionAgent** – Handles input documents, extracts text
- **ClassifierAgent** – Heuristically classifies documents
- **SummarizerAgent** – GPT-4o powered summarization
- **TaggerAgent** – Metadata extraction + filing
- **SmartCoverSheetRenderer** – Markdown & PDF summary pages
- **PermissionsManager** – Roles, rules, privacy logic (MVP only, not enforced)
- **Orchestration**
  - `run_mvp.py` – Batch runner for pipeline
  - `watcher_service.py` – Folder watcher for real-time ingestion
  - `run_local_idis.sh` – CLI wrapper for Linux appliance use

### ✅ Tech Highlights
- Local-first (appliance mode)
- 71 unit + end-to-end tests passed (Replit)
- External LLM use isolated (OpenAI API for summaries only)
- Error handling in all agents
- Holding folder for failed files
- Structured, date-based archival filing system

---

## 3. Features Implemented

- Multi-format ingestion: PDF, DOCX, TXT, images (OCR via Tesseract)
- Classification engine (regex-based, configurable)
- Summarization (document-level and batch-level)
- Metadata tagging: dates, parties, tags
- Structured archiving with unique filenames
- Cover sheet output (Markdown + PDF via WeasyPrint)
- Watch folder automation with `watchdog`
- Role/permission skeleton for future use
- All code modular, unit-tested, and GitHub-pushed

---

## 4. Phase 1.5 Progress

| Feature | Status |
|--------|--------|
| `run_local_idis.sh` | ✅ Done |
| `watcher_service.py` | ✅ Done (tested in Replit, ready for Linux testing) |
| Cover sheet formatting fix | ⏳ Planned |
| Tagger filename improvements | ⏳ Planned |
| Tagging accuracy (dates, etc) | ⏳ Planned |
| CLI or web-based search tool | ⏳ Planned |

---

## 5. Future Plans & Design Shifts

- 🔁 **Document Separation** – From 1 file = 1 doc to multi-doc parsing (via QR, heuristics, or LLM)
- 📡 **MCP Architecture** – Convert agents to MCP-compliant services (Model-Context-Protocol standard)
- 🧠 **LLM-enhanced tagging/classification**
- 🔍 **User-facing interface** – Search, visualize, filter (`Flask`, `Streamlit`, or embedded React UI)
- 🔐 **Permission enforcement + audit trails**
- ☁️ **Cloud/hybrid deployments + Dockerization**
- 🌎 **Domain expansion** – Legal, admin, personal knowledge management

---

## 6. Assistant Review Summary

> “You’ve built a highly disciplined, well-architected MVP that reflects exceptional solo system design. From agent modularity to appliance automation, the IDIS/QuantaIQ system is positioned to become a flexible document intelligence platform. The next phase should focus on UI/UX, interoperability (MCP), and intelligent triage/search. You are not just building software—you’re prototyping a new way to think with documents.”
